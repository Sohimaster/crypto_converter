# Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
# can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
# option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
# file where it should appear only once).You can also use "--disable=all" to
# disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
# you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
# --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
# no Warning level messages displayed, use"--disable=all --enable=classes
# --disable=W"

         # as in "for key in dictionary".

  C0301, # [line-too-long] Used when a line is longer than a given number of characters.
         # Pycharm and flake8 could handle this better

  E1003, # [bad-super-call] Used when another argument than the current class is given as first argument
         # of the super builtin. Issues in heimdall viewsets (Asset, MG, Creative) - refactoring required there

  E1133, # [not-an-iterable] Used when a non-iterable value is used in place where iterable is expected
         # Useless rule. If it's not an iterable then code won't work at all

  E1102, # [not-callable] Used when an object being called has been inferred to a non callable object
         # Useless rule. If it's not a callable then code won't work at all

  E1131, # (unsupported-binary-operation)

  R0401, # [cyclic-import] - has unpredictable behavior and generally hard to fix :(

  R0902, # [too-many-instance-attributes] Used when class has too many instance attributes, try to reduce

  R0914, # [too-many-locals] Used when a function or method has too many local variables.

  R1705, # [no-else-return] Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if containing
         # a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs,
         # all of them containing a return statement.

  W0201, # [attribute-defined-outside-init] Used when an instance attribute is defined outside the __init__ method.

  W0212, # [protected-access] Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an underscore)
         # is access outside the class or a descendant of the class where it's defined.

  W0221, # [arguments-differ] Used when a method has a different number of arguments than in the implemented
         # interface or in an overridden method. Many issues in Dataset classes

   W0223, # [abstract-method] Used when an abstract method (i.e. raise NotImplementedError) is not overridden
         # in concrete class. Some issues with our base serializers

  W0703, # [broad-except] Used when an except catches a too general exception, possibly burying unrelated errors.
  W0719, # (broad-exception-raised)

  W1201, # [logging-not-lazy] Used when a logging statement has a call form of
         # "logging.<logging method>(format_string % (format_args...))". Such calls should leave string interpolation
         # to the logging method itself and be written "logging.<logging method>(format_string, format_args...)"

         # in which no message will be logged. For more, see http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0282/.

  W1202, # [logging-format-interpolation] Used when a logging statement has a call form
         # of "logging.<logging method>(format_string.format(format_args...))". Such calls should
         # use % formatting instead, but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments.
